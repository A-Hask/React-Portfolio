      <p>
        My name is Arlene Haskins and I'm a full stack developer based in
        Charleston, SC!
        <br />
        I received my certificate in Full Stack Development from Michigan State
        University and
        <br />
        I'm looking forward to being part of a team where I can collaborate
        efficiently and creatively to make fun and exciting projects.
        <br />
        My coding languages are HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Mongoose, and React,
        <br />
        and I've worked with technologies such as MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js,
        APIs, and more.
